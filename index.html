	<h2>What does Crab mentality?</h2>

		<p>It is Understandable if we start being cautious and selective when it comes to meeting new people or befriending old ones. Do not let those crabs make we a hateful and anxious person. There are times when you have had enough of these crabs in a barrel and you just want to explode but do not give them that pleasure to see you lose your cool.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Let your success speak for itself.</li> 
	<li>Be optimistic.</li>
	<li>Keep doing what you are doing.</li>
	<li>Be yourself.</li>
</ol>
